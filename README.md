The application uses a multi-factor NLP approach:

1. **Description Analysis**: Scans hotel descriptions for noise-related keywords
2. **Facility Assessment**: Analyzes amenities that may contribute to noise (bars, clubs, busy streets)
3. **Location Context**: Considers proximity to attractions and city centers
4. **Composite Scoring**: Combines factors into a noise pollution prediction score

### Air Quality Integration
- Real-time AQI fetching using hotel coordinates
- Integration with OpenWeather Air Pollution API
- Historical and current air quality data visualization

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient pandas operations for large dataset handling
- Cached API calls to reduce response times
- Streamlined UI components for better user experience
